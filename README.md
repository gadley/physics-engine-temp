physics-engine-temp
===================
Elastic collision of simulated particles. This program demonstrates that a change in the volume of a system results in a change in temperature.

In physics temperature is the average kinetic energy of particles. This program tracks the average velocity (kinetic energy) and shows the change in temperature.

Decrease volume by pressing up arrow. Increase volume by pressing down arrow.
